# GA4GH Beacon at Microsoft

Welcome to the central repository for all things related to the GA4GH Beacon project at Microsoft. This repository currently hosts the [`code-generation`](/code-generation/) tool, which is used to generate client and server libraries for the GA4GH Beacon API.

## What is GA4GH Beacon?

The GA4GH Beacon is an API standard developed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health  ([GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)) that enables developers to create tools for querying the presence of genomic variants across distributed datasets. By implementing the Beacon API, developers can facilitate secure and privacy-preserving data discovery. This API supports global collaboration in genomic research by making it easier to find relevant datasets without exposing sensitive data.
