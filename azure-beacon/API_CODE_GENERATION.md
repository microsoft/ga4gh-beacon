### Endpoints server code generation

Run following command to generated endpoints code:
```./utils/api-code-gen.sh```

The output folder is `.beacon-v2/beacon-v2/.server-generated`

!! Warning currently it generates code only for datasets endpoint. Script required some modification to take other endpoint into consideration.
